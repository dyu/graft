# sqlite-plugin

`sqlite-plugin` provides a streamlined and flexible way to implement SQLite virtual file systems (VFS) in Rust. Inspired by [sqlite-vfs], it offers a distinct design with key enhancements:

- **Centralized Control**: The `Vfs` trait intercepts all file operations at the VFS level, rather than delegating them directly to file handles. This simplifies shared state management and enables more advanced behaviors.
- **Custom Pragmas**: Easily define and handle custom SQLite pragmas to extend database functionality.
- **Integrated Logging**: Seamlessly forward logs to SQLiteâ€™s built-in logging system for unified diagnostics.
